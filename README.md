# InteractiveSystems Colorslava 3D assets, audio, animations
In this first delivery of our project ColorsLava, we have implemented several assests as well as functionalities:
- We have created the interactive floor. Since we needed a grid of independent cube colors, we have programmed it.
- The assets of the spotlight (focuses and other structure).
- We have imported the music that will appear in the levels as well as implemented a default song as a start in loop.
- The timer in an approximate position of the floor.
- Other important files in the project such as the materials of the cubes.
- Extra assets related to the topic of our game in case we wanted to add them.
