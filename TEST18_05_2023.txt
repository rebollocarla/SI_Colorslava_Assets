In the first lab session we tested all the advances made in our game, including:
- The sounds and music.
- The sizes and colors of the board.
- The initial illumination (check if we needed extra spotlights or with the illumination of the surroundings was good)
- How the colors changed over the time.
- How could we phisically interact with the board (next session we will check the interactivity of the squares).

From here, the next steps are: 
- Correct the size of the board to match with the lab 
- Interactivity of the squares with the sensors.
- Implement different levels with changes.
- Starting to distribute different scripts with different scenes (changing level).
- Implement the initial scene.
- Implement the counter.
